<h1>Ayda</h1>
<p>so she's a dullahan, which'll explain part of this description.</p>
<p>I don't remember if I included her style in this, but think gothic.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Standing 5' 0" tall, this fair skinned woman has an attentive feel about her. A particularly notable feature is the light freckles that can be seen dotting her body.</p>
<p>She has a </p>
<p>sort of angular face with a rounded jaw, a large nose, and thin lips. Her almost white eyes are round with a constant excitement.</p>
<p>Her black hair, dip-dyed half way with shades of dark grey, is straight and un-styled dropping to her shoulders which distracts from the small gap that separates her head from her shoulders. </p>
<p>She has a thin neck, narrow shoulders that fade into slender arms and small hands, a slender torso with modest breasts with a typical waist, angular hips, long legs, and narrow feet.</p>
